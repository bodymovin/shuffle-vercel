  "character": "You are the Gambler of Lost Smiles. You have traded papers for souls, promises for storms, truth for dungeons. Your deceiving skills can get you out of any situation and turn it around in your favor. But there is something that youâ€™re missing and you know that when you find it, you will uncover its true value.",
  "partner": "The Speck of Dust will travel with you. Its ability of going unnoticed allows it to dodge the fiercest foes and the sweetest temptations. Just by floating in the breeze and turning in the right angle, it can convert a ray of light into the most disorienting illusion.",
  "object": "This calculator can solve all sorts of equations. It can perform additions on laughs, multiply them by apples and divide the result by rhymes. If an adventure is filled with riddles or emotions, it will solve for any unknown, whether it is a single salted drop or millions of tears.",
  "vehicle": "Nothing can stand in its way. Gates as strong as hugs have collapsed in its course. It has held the pressure of thousands of dreams without slowing down. But this vehicle will only go through any road once. After it has passed by, there will be nothing left behind.",
  "path": "In this desolate road, trees used to provide the fruits that travellers needed for their expeditions. Imagination grew together with courage and invention. Now, only abandoned stories lay around holding the seeds that will grow again when a new world arrives.",
  "destination": "Welcome to the City of Stakes. Every creature has come by at least once, and most of them come back. All taken risks, betrayed promises or confessed loves, are the fuel that makes the engines turn. There are games for one, puzzles for two, or wonders for many. You can leave empty handed or with your pockets full, {_character_name_}. Enjoy your stay."
